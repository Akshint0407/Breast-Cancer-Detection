# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to compare different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection based on their accuracy and performance metrics. By analyzing multiple models, we identify the best-performing approach for early and accurate diagnosis.

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Preprocess and analyze the dataset for breast cancer detection.  
- Train multiple machine learning models and compare their performance.  
- Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Provide insights into the most effective algorithm for diagnosis.  

## 🔧 Machine Learning Models Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Naïve Bayes  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:  
✔️ Accuracy  
✔️ Confusion Matrix
